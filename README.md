## Let's have fun, connect and *make systems*!
A little about me...

My expertise is in crisis support and suicide prevention. It's what I write about all over the internet.

I believe *everybody* deserves access to world class **communication and listening tools**. It's my mission to help millions to connect to their loved ones and community.

I love systems thinking and I really want to express and explore that through designing idle games. I've got some idiologies I'm lowkey *obsessed* with plus I have some big goals.
1. 50,000 followers across social medias
2. 200+ top tier posts on my blog
3. 15,000 readers of my newsletter

Plus a bunch of others but these ones are for **2026**

If you've found my work somewhere about the place and want to say hi, please do! I'd love to meet you.
